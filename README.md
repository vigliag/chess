## What's this?

It is a (very very) little game server I and Gabriele Prestifilippo wrote to experiment with
socket.io. Currently it has the minimal functionalities to allow playing chess
by opening a room and sharing the link.

## Idea

The idea was creating a website where two friends can choose a game and immediately
begin playing together by simply sharing the link, as it is commonly done with collaborative
text editors, like Etherpad.

## Libraries

* socket.io
* [chess.js](https://github.com/jhlywa/chess.js/)
* [chessboard.js](http://chessboardjs.com/)
